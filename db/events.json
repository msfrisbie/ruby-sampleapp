    "description":"Packed with hipsters and a diverse crowd that feels hella Oakland, Sunday brunch here is a party. No wonder: Blanca Arechiga’s Victorian-storefront cafe serves up some of the city’s brightest-tasting morning food — like ceviche Benedict, with its roasted pepper-coconut sauce and sparkly hash of shrimp, tilapia, and mango. Lemon ricotta pancakes are dense and custardy, while graham-cracker-crusted French toast is sponge-cake light. Stick with the a.m., though; the weekday lunch chow is on the clunky side.",

Grilled chicken over ginger noodles is a home-style dish you could dip your chopsticks into once a week, while grilled beef udon in curry broth is lush and satisfying. Noodles can be a tad overcooked, but you’ll happily slurp everything around them.",

But on Cal football game days, Henry's is definitely the place to be (besides the game itself). This place opens up and there are lots of alumni standing around and watching the game. The back patio is also open. It can be mildly lively or awesomely crowded depending on which game you're watching. Get a Golden Bear ($9) - orange juice, southern comfort, amaretto, and a float of 151. Or get a Bloody Mary. Dangerously delicious. ",

The staff and brewers are good people, of course very knowledgeable, but more importantly friendly and approachable about the brand, it's history and style. Highly recommend going on a tour, or for one of their special events.",

The upstairs area has yet another bar, some pool tables, and a tiki themed balcony with heat lamps. The clash of the rustic and the tiki oddly works extremely well, probably because it's hilarious. The hallway is covered with children's photos which is both creepy and adorable and mesmerizing when waiting in line for the bathroom. ",
