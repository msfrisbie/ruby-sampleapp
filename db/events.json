The goal of my ethnographic study was to approximate an experimental design and isolate the effects of social policies and national culture. First, I find that not only do the content of policies matter, but also how they are implemented. Sluggish, bureaucratic, and antagonistic institutions of government, unions, and corporations failed workers in both countries, providing little except band-aids for their intractable labor-market problems. Second, I argue that a meritocratic ideology of individualism is becoming more influential even among unionized blue-collar workers, contrary to past work.

This idea only becomes more than a loose analogy, though, if there is a theory of communication that can add something substantial to our understanding of memory. I'll argue that recent models of communication, developed for quite different applications, can indeed play this role.

  , {"description":"Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistors (CNFETs) are excellent candidates for building highly energy-efficient future electronic systems. Unfortunately, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are subject to substantial inherent imperfections that pose major obstacles to the design of robust and very large-scale CNFET digital systems:\n\n• It is nearly impossible to guarantee perfect alignment and positioning of all CNTs. This limitation introduces stray conducting paths, resulting in incorrect circuit functionality.\n\n• CNTs can be metallic or semiconducting depending on chirality. Metallic CNTs cause shorts resulting in excessive leakage and incorrect circuit functionality.\n\nA combination of design and processing technique overcomes these challenges by creating robust CNFET digital circuits that are immune to these inherent imperfections. This imperfection-immune design paradigm enables the first experimental demonstration of the carbon\nnanotube computer, and, more generally, arbitrary digital systems that can be built using CNFETs. Demonstration of monolithically integrated three-dimensional CNFET circuits will also be discussed.\n\nThis research was performed at Stanford University in collaboration with Prof. H.-S.

Arguably the greatest challenge for this vision is to develop efficient CO2 reduction catalysts. \n\nThis talk will describe our development of “oxide-derived” metal nanoparticle electrocatalysts. Oxide-derived metal nanoparticles are prepared by electrochemically reducing metal oxide precursors, which results in highly strained nanocrystals. \n\nI will describe examples of these catalysts that electrochemically reduce CO2 to CO with exceptional energetic efficiency as well as a catalyst that selectively reduces CO to two-carbon oxygenates. The catalysts operate in water at ambient temperature and pressure and are remarkably robust. The reduction mechanisms will be discussed based on electrokinetic measurements. Metal oxide reduction represents a “top-down” approach to metal nanoparticle synthesis that produces unique surface structures for catalysis.","categories":["Lecture"],"address":"Hearst Memorial Mining BuildingBerkeley, California 94720 Directions Save Street View University Be the first to review Street View Map data ©2013 GoogleTermsPrivacyReport a problem\t 100 m Show imagery Earth","image_url":"http://kananlab.stanford.edu/images/matt.jpg","time_ranges":[{"start":1382130000,"end":1382140800}]}

Since 2010 territorial disputes over such areas as the the Senkaku/Diaoyu island group have intensified, raising anxieties over destabilized international relations across the region in both Asia and the US. A panel of experts revisit the crisis in the region, followed by discussions with UC Berkeley faculty analyzing the evolving situation and the role of the US in the wake of its “pivot to Asia.”\n\nSpeakers:\nRalf Emmers, S.

US President Barack Obama has in recent years reinvigorated American strategic influence in the region through a pivot or rebalance to Asia. This talk assesses how and the extent to which the US rebalancing has impacted the South China Sea disputes. The South China Sea is at the center of competing territorial, economic, and strategic interests. The issue is complicated by the number of disputants. While the claimants to the Paracel Islands are the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Taiwan, and Vietnam, six states assert ownership over the Spratly Islands and/or their surrounding waters, namely, Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. The presentation first examines the origins and main characteristics of the US rebalancing to Asia before describing the traditional American position on the sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea. It argues that the United States has not taken sides in the disputes and has restricted its interest to the preservation of the freedom of navigation. It then discusses whether and to what extent Washington has changed its position in recent years in response to renewed Chinese assertiveness in the disputed waters. It also reviews regional responses to the US involvement and concludes by assessing its impact on the peaceful management of the South China Sea disputes.\n\n\nDustin Kuan-Hsiung Wang\nProfessor\nGraduate Institute of Political Science,\nNational Taiwan Normal University\n\n\"China’s Marine Policy on Asserting Sovereignty over Islands in East and South China Seas: Legal and Political Perspectives\"\n\nObserving from the heated developments over the Diaoyutai Islands in the East China Sea with Japan and Spratly Islands in the South China Sea with the Philippines and Vietnam, it is a common criticism what China has done in enhancing its maritime claims is through coercion and intimidation towards its neighbours. Is it really so? Also, what kind of policy tools that China operates to express its determination in maintaining sovereignty over those islands? \n\n\nTara Davenport\nFulbright Scholar\nYale Law School\n\n\"The Philippines’ Arbitral Proceedings Against China on the South China Sea Disputes: Latest Developments and Legal Implications\"\n\nSabre-rattling and confrontations at sea. Claim and counter-claim. Protest and counter-protest. Undoubtedly, the South China Sea has been the stage of one of the most complex international disputes in recent years. The sovereignty dispute between multiple state actors over small offshore features in the South China Sea and the accompanying claims to maritime resources surrounding such features have long been a flashpoint for tension in the region. The technical and legal questions are complicated enough but coupled with the competing threads of nationalism, history and big power geopolitics that are inherent in the South China Sea disputes, a long-term solution does not appear to be in sight. \n\nIn 2012, in an unprecedented move that took the international community by surprise, the Philippines initiated arbitral proceedings against China under Annex VII of UNCLOS over the latter’s claims in the South China Sea, including the validity of China’s u-shaped line. Opinion is divided on whether the Philippines’ course of action will move the disputes towards a peaceful resolution or whether it will exacerbate an already precarious situation. In this regard, the Seminar will give an overview of the Philippines-China arbitral proceedings and will outline the latest developments. It will then explore possible outcomes of the arbitral proceedings and discuss the legal and political implications of each of these outcomes. \n\n\nGreg Poling\nResearch Associate \nSoutheast Asia Program\nCenter for Strategic and International Studies\n\n“The South China Sea in Focus: Clarifying the Limits of Maritime Dispute.”\n\nSatellite imagery and geospatial analysis tools offer an unprecedented opportunity to harness new technologies in order to help resolve boundary disputes. In The South China Sea in Focus: Clarifying the Limits of Maritime Dispute, Gregory Poling uses these tools to provide a first and necessary step toward tackling the overlapping maritime disputes in the South China Sea: determining which waters are and are not in dispute under international law. Mr. Poling uses geographic information system (GIS)–based maps to provide an easily understandable benchmark against which policymakers and academics can judge the claims and actions of the South China Sea claimants. Only if the parties to the dispute are willing to clarify their sovereignty claims and agree on what is legally in dispute will they be able to effectively manage tensions and agree to joint development in the region.","categories":["Lecture"],"address":"Institute of East Asian Studies 2223 Fulton St Berkeley, CA 94720","image_url":"http://ieas.berkeley.edu/images/logo.png","time_ranges":[{"start":1382133600,"end":1380679200}]} 
  , {"title":"ITS Friday Seminar: Dynamic Weather Routes: The Search for Smarter Flight Routes","description":"Adverse weather is the leading cause of flight delay in the US National Airspace System. Airline flight dispatchers must file flight plans about an hour before push-back from the gate using their best available weather forecasts. FAA traffic managers assess the impact of weather on traffic flows, and, when necessary, implement standard reroutes for groups of flights. Given the uncertainty in weather, standardized reroutes may result in large buffers between flight routes and forecast weather. Weather changes as flights progress along planned routes, and because airline dispatchers and FAA traffic managers are busy, especially during weather events, they may miss workable opportunities for more efficient routes around weather. Dynamic Weather Routes (DWR) is a search engine that continuously and automatically analyzes in-flight aircraft in en route airspace and proposes simple route amendments for more efficient routes around convective weather while considering winds aloft, sector congestion, traffic conflicts, and active Special Use Airspace. NASA and American Airlines (AA) are conducting an operational trial of DWR at the AA System Operations Center in Fort Worth, Texas. A key result of the trial is that since airline operators are especially busy during weather events, it is more effective to let the automation identify and alert users to potentially high-value reroute options.","categories":["Lecture"],"address":"534 Davis Hall University of California Berkeley Berkeley, CA 94709","image_url":"http://www.keyt.com/image/view/-/176752/medRes/2/-/maxh/360/maxw/640/-/1lwjlg/-/NASA-logo-jpg.jpg","time_ranges":[{"start":1382137200,"end":1382151600}]}
